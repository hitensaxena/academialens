## Architecture Overview

AcademiaLens is structured into the following core modules:

- Universal Input & Ingestion Engine
- Insight Extractor
- Deconstruction Toolkit
- Synthesis & Connection Hub
- Application & Foresight Engine

The backend leverages PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, and authentication is handled via NextAuth.js. The front end is built using Next.js App Router, Zustand for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Getting Started

### Authentication Setup (NextAuth.js & Google)

1. **Generate a NextAuth secret:**

   ```sh
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

   Place it in your `.env` and `.env.example` as `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.

2. **Google OAuth Credentials:**

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - Create an OAuth Client ID for a web application
   - Set Authorized redirect URI to: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to your `.env` and `.env.example`:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
     ```

3. **Example .env values:**
   ```env
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   ```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 9+

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Authentication Flow & Security

### Login & Registration

- Users can log in or register using email/password or Google OAuth.
- Forms provide real-time validation for email format, password length, and required fields.
- Clear, accessible error and success messages are shown for all actions.

### Callback URL Handling & Infinite Redirect Protection

- All callback URLs are sanitized in both middleware and auth pages.
- Unsafe callback URLs (pointing to `/auth/` or containing nested `callbackUrl` params) are ignored, preventing infinite redirect loops.
- Authenticated users accessing `/auth/login` or `/auth/register` are redirected to the dashboard.

### Middleware Route Protection

- The middleware (in `middleware.ts` at the project root) protects all routes except public ones (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/`).
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page, with a safe callback URL if applicable.
- Authenticated users are prevented from accessing auth routes.

### How to Test

- Try accessing protected pages as unauthenticated: you should be redirected to login, then to your intended page after login.
- Try accessing `/auth/login` as an authenticated user: you should be redirected to the dashboard.
- Try manipulating `callbackUrl` with `/auth/` or nested parameters: you should never get stuck in a redirect loop.
- All error/success states should be clear and accessible.

### Extending Authentication

- To add new providers (e.g., GitHub), configure them in your NextAuth setup.
- To change redirect logic, update the middleware and auth page logic.
- To further improve UX, enhance form validation, add social logins, or polish UI with Tailwind.

### Security Notes

- Callback URLs are always sanitized to prevent open redirect and loop vulnerabilities.
- Only public routes are accessible without authentication; all others are protected by middleware.
