## AI Prompt: Redesign AcademiaLens Dashboard for Academic Workflow

**Goal:** Generate a comprehensive UX/UI description for the AcademiaLens dashboard, transforming it into a highly actionable, insight-driven "Research Workspace Hub" that feels like a natural extension of an academic scholar's workflow, explicitly avoiding an "admin panel" aesthetic.

**Context:** AcademiaLens is an AI-powered suite for researchers, PhD students, and academics to ingest, deconstruct, and synthesize complex information (PDFs, video transcripts, technical descriptions, website content). The dashboard should empower users to quickly resume ongoing work, initiate new analyses, and surface critical AI-generated insights.

**Core Directive:** Focus on **Action, Continuity, Insight, Personalization, and Clarity**. Design the dashboard to be the scholar's central point for managing their research progress and leveraging AI, rather than just viewing system statistics.

**Specific Sections to Refine/Add and Their Focus:**

1.  **"Your Research Snapshot" (Hero/Overview):**

    - **Personalization:** Greet the user by name.
    - **High-Level Progress:** Display key metrics framed as _research progress_ and _AI value generated_, not just raw counts. Examples: "Papers Processed," "Active Investigations," "Insights Generated (AI-driven)."
    - **Immediate Call to Action:** A prominent, central button to initiate the primary research workflow (e.g., "Start New Research").

2.  **"Continue Your Work" (Recent Activity & Status):**

    - **Continuity:** Focus on documents and projects that are _in progress_ or _recently completed analyses_.
    - **Status Visuals:** Use clear, intuitive visual cues (icons, subtle badges, progress bars) to indicate processing status ("Analyzing," "Synthesis Complete," "Awaiting Review," "Q&A Active").
    - **Direct Actions:** Provide direct "Resume," "View Insights," or "Continue Q&A" buttons for each item.

3.  **"Initiate New Research" (Core Actions):**

    - **Action-Oriented:** Present clear, inviting buttons for starting new research tasks.
    - **Workflow-Driven:** Group actions by common research starting points (ingestion types, project creation).

4.  **"Latest Discoveries & AI Insights" (New Emphasis):**

    - **Proactive Insights:** This is a crucial new section. Display AI-generated snippets of significant findings, emerging themes, identified knowledge gaps, or critical claims from _recent analyses_.
    - **Contextual Links:** Each insight snippet should link directly back to the relevant document or project within the application for deeper exploration.
    - **Dynamic Feed:** This section should feel like an intelligent, personalized feed of AI observations.

5.  **"Your Knowledge Base Growth" (Reframed Metrics):**
    - **Value-Oriented:** Reframe document counts as the growth of the user's personal knowledge base.
    - **Usage Transparency:** Clearly but subtly display AI analysis credits/usage, ensuring it's informative without being alarming.

**UI/UX Elements to Emphasize:**

- **Shadcn UI:** Leverage components like `Card`, `Button`, `Tabs`, `Input`, `Progress`, `Badge`, `Dialog`, `Toast`.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Ensure full responsiveness, clean spacing, and modern aesthetics.
- **Lucide React:** Use relevant icons to enhance visual understanding and navigation.
- **Typography:** Clear hierarchy, professional fonts (e.g., Inter).
- **Color Palette:** Professional, calming academic tones with strategic use of accent colors for actions and highlights.
- **Micro-interactions:** Subtle hover effects, clear loading indicators, and smooth transitions.

**Output Format:** Provide a detailed markdown description of the UX/UI for this redesigned dashboard, with specific examples of content and component usage.

## AcademiaLens: Research Workspace Hub - UX/UI Redesign

This document outlines the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) for the AcademiaLens dashboard, reimagined as a dynamic "Research Workspace Hub" tailored specifically for academic scholars. The design prioritizes enabling immediate action, fostering workflow continuity, and proactively surfacing AI-generated insights, moving distinctly away from a generic administrative panel.

### Guiding Principles:

- **Action-Oriented:** Every element encourages the next step in the research process.
- **Continuity:** Seamlessly pick up where you left off.
- **Insight-Driven:** AI doesn't just process; it highlights what matters.
- **Personalized:** The hub reflects _your_ research, _your_ progress, _your_ discoveries.
- **Clarity & Calm:** A clean, uncluttered interface reduces cognitive load, allowing focus on research.

### Overall Layout & Structure

The layout maintains the established clean, modern, and responsive design using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.

- **Left Sidebar (Persistent Navigation):**

  - **Purpose:** The bedrock of navigation, providing consistent access to core research functionalities.
  - **Elements:**
    - **AcademiaLens Logo/Branding:** Prominent, top-left.
    - **Primary Navigation (Lucide React Icons + Text Labels):**
      - `Dashboard` (Active State: Primary entry point)

      - `Analysis Tools` (A library of all available AI analysis modules)
      - `Research Projects` (Multi-document synthesis and collaborative workspaces)
      - `Ingest New` (Direct access to upload/paste/URL analysis)
      - `Settings` (Profile, Subscription, Integrations)
    - **User/Workspace Indicator (Bottom-left):** A small circular avatar/initials for the current user. Hovering reveals user name and current subscription tier. Clicking opens a quick menu for "My Profile," "Manage Subscription," "Logout."
  - **UX:** Intuitive icons and clear labels. The active section is visually distinct (e.g., a vibrant accent color background or a bold left border).

- **Top Header (Global Context & Quick Access):**

  - **Purpose:** Universal search, critical notifications, and user-specific controls, always visible.
  - **Elements:**
    - **Global Search Bar:** Prominent, centrally located. Placeholder text: "Search across your papers, projects, and insights..." (Shadcn UI `Input` with `Search` icon). This is crucial for retrieving specific information from their entire knowledge base.
    - **Notifications Bell:** (Lucide React `Bell` icon) With a small, dynamic badge indicating unread notifications (e.g., "Analysis Complete," "New Insight," "Project Shared," "Usage Alert"). Clicking opens a non-blocking dropdown or slide-over panel summarizing recent alerts.
    - **User Avatar/Initials:** (e.g., "HS") Clicking opens a dropdown for "My Profile," "Settings," "Logout."
  - **UX:** Non-intrusive, always available, provides a quick gateway to critical information and system alerts.

- **Main Content Area ("My Research Hub"):**
  - **Purpose:** The dynamic heart of the dashboard, presenting personalized content tailored to the researcher's immediate needs and recent activity.
  - **Layout:** Utilizes a flexible, responsive grid system (Tailwind CSS) to arrange various "cards" and content blocks. This fluid layout ensures optimal viewing on any device.
