# Sprint 4.5 – Dashboard Design Update (Research Workspace Hub)

**Sprint Goal:**
Implement the actionable, personalized, and insight-driven dashboard redesign for AcademiaLens as described in the dashboard-design.md plan, transforming the dashboard into a "Research Workspace Hub" for academic scholars.

---

## Key Objectives

- Redesign dashboard to include:
  - **Your Research Snapshot (Hero/Overview):** Personalized greeting, progress metrics, and a prominent call-to-action (e.g., "Start New Research").
  - **Continue Your Work:** Recent activity and status, with visual cues for in-progress and recently completed work, and direct "Resume" or "View Insights" actions.
  - **Initiate New Research:** Action-oriented buttons for all common research entry points (upload, analyze URL, transcribe video, start project, paste text).
  - **Latest Discoveries & AI Insights:** Dynamic feed of AI-generated insights, with contextual links and actionable highlights.
  - **Knowledge Base Growth:** Reframed metrics to show knowledge base expansion and AI usage transparency.
- Implement modern UI/UX as per dashboard-design.md:
  - Use Shadcn UI components (`Card`, `Button`, `Badge`, `Dialog`, etc.), Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React icons.
  - Ensure full responsiveness, clear hierarchy, and academic-friendly visual design.
  - Add micro-interactions, loading indicators, and empty states.
- Update documentation and README to reflect the new dashboard experience.
