# Sprint 1: Project Initialization & Core Infrastructure

## Sprint Goal

Establish the foundational project structure and essential development tools for AcademiaLens.

## Key Deliverables

- Next.js 14+ project initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, App Router, and ESLint.
- Git repository set up with .gitignore and Husky pre-commit hooks.
- Project directory structure established.
- Prettier configured for code formatting.
- Continuous Integration (CI) workflow stubbed.

## Detailed Tasks

1. Initialize a new Next.js project:
   - `npx create-next-app@latest academialens --typescript --tailwind --app --eslint`
2. Set up project directory structure following the architecture guide.
3. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.
4. Initialize a Git repository and add a `.gitignore` file.
5. Set up Husky for pre-commit linting and formatting.
6. Create a basic README with project overview and setup instructions.
7. Add a CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) for linting and test stubs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Developers can clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the dev server.
- All code passes linting and formatting checks on commit.
- Initial project structure matches agreed architecture.
